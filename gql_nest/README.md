# About
Pretty often we can have deal with types, that almost the same, but not the same.
Simply speaking these decorators allow declare new types with Pick/Omit mechanism.
But do this in strict declarative way, in context of nestjs and graphql.
Also strictly control over optional or required fields.

#### TODO
From one side these decorators show self as pretty handy utility.
But on practice the interface of their usage is not ideal.
There are a lot of improvments for their design.
